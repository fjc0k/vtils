|  [nohoist?](./types.packagejson.workspaceconfig.nohoist.md) |  | [WorkspacePattern](./types.packagejson.workspacepattern.md)<!-- -->\[\] | <p>_(Optional)_ Designed to solve the problem of packages which break when their <code>node_modules</code> are moved to the root workspace directory - a process known as hoisting. For these packages, both within your workspace, and also some that have been installed via <code>node_modules</code>, it is important to have a mechanism for preventing the default Yarn workspace behavior. By adding workspace pattern strings here, Yarn will resume non-workspace behavior for any package which matches the defined patterns.</p><p>\[Read more\](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/)</p> |
