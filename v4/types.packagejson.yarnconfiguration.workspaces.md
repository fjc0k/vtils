## PackageJson.YarnConfiguration.workspaces property

Used to configure \[Yarn workspaces\](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/docs/workspaces/).

Workspaces allow you to manage multiple packages within the same repository in such a way that you only need to run `yarn install` once to install all of them in a single pass.

Please note that the top-level `private` property of `package.json` \*\*must\*\* be set to `true` in order to use workspaces.

**Signature:**

```typescript
workspaces?: WorkspacePattern[] | WorkspaceConfig;
```
