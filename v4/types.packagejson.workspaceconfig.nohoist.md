## PackageJson.WorkspaceConfig.nohoist property

Designed to solve the problem of packages which break when their `node_modules` are moved to the root workspace directory - a process known as hoisting. For these packages, both within your workspace, and also some that have been installed via `node_modules`<!-- -->, it is important to have a mechanism for preventing the default Yarn workspace behavior. By adding workspace pattern strings here, Yarn will resume non-workspace behavior for any package which matches the defined patterns.
