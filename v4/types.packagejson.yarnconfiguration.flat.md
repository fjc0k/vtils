## PackageJson.YarnConfiguration.flat property

If your package only allows one version of a given dependency, and youâ€™d like to enforce the same behavior as `yarn install --flat` on the command-line, set this to `true`<!-- -->.

Note that if your `package.json` contains `"flat": true` and other packages depend on yours (e.g. you are building a library rather than an app), those other packages will also need `"flat": true` in their `package.json` or be installed with `yarn install --flat` on the command-line.

**Signature:**

```typescript
flat?: boolean;
```
